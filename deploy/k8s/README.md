# k8s deploy
This folder is used internaly by hanko to test hanko in a kubernetes setup using [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) and [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize)
running in a [kind cluster](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) that got set up by [gentle](https://github.com/like-a-bause/gentle).

While this is a "hanko tailored" setup you can use these yamls as a base for your own kubernetes deployment.
