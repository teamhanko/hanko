# Hanko elements

Provides web components that will bring a modern login and registration experience
to your users. It integrates the [Hanko API](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/blob/main/backend/README.md), a backend
that provides the underlying functionalities.

## Features

* Registration and login flows with and without passwords
* Passkey authentication
* Passcodes, a convenient way to recover passwords and verify email addresses
* Email, Password and Passkey management
* Customizable UI

## Installation

```shell
# npm
npm install @teamhanko/hanko-elements

# yarn
yarn add @teamhanko/hanko-elements

# pnpm
pnpm install @teamhanko/hanko-elements
```

## Usage

### Script

The web components need to be registered first. You can control whether they should be attached to the shadow DOM or not
using the `shadow` property. It's set to true by default, and it's possible to make use of the [CSS shadow parts](#css-shadow-parts)
to change the appearance of the component. [CSS variables](#css-variables) will work in both cases. The `register`
function returns an instance of the `hanko-frontend-sdk`, that enables you e.g. to fetch user information, or bind event
listeners.

Use as a module:

```typescript
import { register } from "@teamhanko/hanko-elements";

const { hanko } = await register("https://hanko.yourdomain.com", {
  shadow: true,         // Set to false if you don't want the web component to be attached to the shadow DOM.
  injectStyles: true,   // Set to false if you don't want to inject any default styles.
  enablePasskeys: true, // Set to false if you don't want passkeys to be enabled.
});
```

With a script tag via CDN:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { register } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@teamhanko/hanko-elements/dist/elements.js";

  const { hanko } = await register("https://hanko.yourdomain.com", {
    shadow: true,         // Set to false if you don't want the web component to be attached to the shadow DOM.
    injectStyles: true,   // Set to false if you don't want to inject any default styles.
    enablePasskeys: true, // Set to false if you don't want passkeys to be enabled.
  });
</script>
```

### &lt;hanko-auth&gt;

A web component that handles user login and user registration.

#### Markup

```html
<hanko-auth lang="en"></hanko-auth>
```

#### Attributes

- `lang` Currently supported values are "en" for English and "de" for German. If the value is omitted, "en" is used.
- `experimental` A space-seperated list of experimental features to be enabled. See [experimental features](#experimental-features).

### &lt;hanko-profile&gt;

A web component that allows to manage emails, passwords and passkeys.

#### Markup

```html
<hanko-profile lang="en"></hanko-profile>
```

#### Attributes

- `lang` Currently supported values are "en" for English and "de" for German. If the value is omitted, "en" is used.

### &lt;hanko-events&gt;

A web component that allows to bind event handler to certain events, without displaying UI elements. Events can be
subscribed to with the `<hanko-auth>` and `<hanko-profile>` components in the same manner. Also, you can bind event
handler via the `frontend-sdk` (see next section).

#### Markup

```html
<hanko-events id="events"></hanko-events>
<script>
  document.getElementById("events").addEventListener("onAuthFlowCompleted", console.log)
  // more events are available (see "frontend-sdk" docs)...
</script>
```

### Frontend-SDK Examples

The following examples will cover some common use-cases for the `hanko-frontend-sdk` instance returned by the `register()`
function, but please take a look into the [frontend-sdk docs](https://docs.hanko.io/jsdoc/hanko-frontend-sdk/) for details.

Note that you can create a `hanko-frontend-sdk` instance without having to register the web components as follows:

```js
import { Hanko } from "@teamhanko/hanko-elements";

const hanko = new Hanko("https://hanko.yourdomain.com")
```

#### Events

It is possible to bind callbacks to different custom events in use of the SDKs event listener functions.
The callback function will be called when the event happens and an object will be passed in, containing event details.

- "hanko-auth-flow-completed": Will be triggered after a session has been created and the user has completed possible
additional steps (e.g. passkey registration or password recovery) via the `<hanko-auth>` element.

```js
hanko.onAuthFlowCompleted((authFlowCompletedDetail) => {
  // Login, registration or recovery has been completed successfully. You can now take control and redirect the
  // user to protected pages.
  console.info(`User successfully completed the registration or authorization process (user-id: "${authFlowCompletedDetail.userID}")`);
})
```

- "hanko-session-created": Will be triggered before the "hanko-auth-flow-completed" happens, as soon as the user is technically logged in.
It will also be triggered when the user logs in via another browser window. The event can be used to obtain the JWT. Please note, that the
JWT is only available, when the Hanko-API configuration allows to obtain the JWT. When using Hanko-Cloud
the JWT is always present, for self-hosted Hanko-APIs you can restrict the cookie to be readable by the backend only, as long as
your backend runs under the same domain as your frontend. To do so, make sure the config parameter "session.enable_auth_token_header"
is turned off via the [Hanko-API configuration](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/blob/main/backend/docs/Config.md). If you want the JWT to be contained in the event details, you need to turn on
"session.enable_auth_token_header" when using a cross-domain setup. When it's a same-domain setup you need to turn off
"session.cookie.http_only" to make the JWT accessible to the frontend.

```js
hanko.onSessionCreated((sessionDetail) => {
  // A new JWT has been issued.
  console.info(`Session created or updated (user-id: "${sessionDetail.userID}", jwt: ${sessionDetail.jwt})`);
})
```

- "hanko-session-resumed": Will be triggered after the page has been loaded and there is a valid session, so it can be
utilized like the "hanko-auth-flow-completed" event, to restore the state of your page, where the user is logged in.
Note, that a "hanko-session-not-present" event will be triggered instead of the "hanko-session-resumed" event, after the
page has been loaded, when the user does not have a valid session.

```js
hanko.onSessionResumed((sessionDetail) => {
  // The user is logged in, protected content can be shown.
  console.info(`User is already logged in (user-id: "${sessionDetail.userID}", jwt: ${sessionDetail.jwt})`);
})
```

- "hanko-session-expired": Will be triggered when the session has expired, or when the session has been removed in
another browser window, because the user has logged out, or deleted the account.

```js
hanko.onSessionExpired(() => {
  // You can redirect the user to a login page or show the `<hanko-auth>` element, or to prompt the user to log in again.
  console.info("Session expired");
})
```

- "hanko-user-logged-out": Will be triggered, when the user actively logs out. In other browser windows, a "hanko-session-expired" event
will be triggered at the same time.

```js
hanko.onUserLoggedOut(() => {
  // You can redirect the user to a login page or show the `<hanko-auth>` element.
  console.info("User logged out");
})
```

- "hanko-user-deleted": Will be triggered when the user has deleted the account. In other browser windows, a "hanko-session-expired" event
will be triggered at the same time.

```js
hanko.onUserDeleted(() => {
  // You can redirect the user to a login page or show the `<hanko-auth>` element.
  console.info("User has been deleted");
})
```

README.

#### User Client

The SDK contains several client classes to make the communication with the Hanko-API easier. Here some examples of
things you might want to do:

- Getting the current user:
```js
const user = await hanko.user.getCurrent();
console.info(`id: ${user.id}, email: ${user.email}`)
```

- Log out a user:
```js
await hanko.user.logout();
```

To learn how error handling works and what else you can do with SDK, take a look into the [frontend-sdk docs](https://docs.hanko.io/jsdoc/hanko-frontend-sdk/).

## UI Customization

### CSS Variables

CSS variables can be used to style the `hanko-auth` and  `hanko-profile` elements to your needs. A list of all CSS
variables including default values can be found below:

```css
hanko-auth, hanko-profile {
  /* Color Scheme */
  --color: #171717;
  --color-shade-1: #8f9095;
  --color-shade-2: #e5e6ef;

  --brand-color: #506cf0;
  --brand-color-shade-1: #6b84fb;
  --brand-contrast-color: white;

  --background-color: white;
  --error-color: #e82020;
  --link-color: #506cf0;

  /* Font Styles */
  --font-weight: 400;
  --font-size: 14px;
  --font-family: sans-serif;

  /* Border Styles */
  --border-radius: 4px;
  --border-style: solid;
  --border-width: 1px;

  /* Item Styles */
  --item-height: 34px;
  --item-margin: .5rem 0;

  /* Container Styles */
  --container-padding: 0;
  --container-max-width: 600px;

  /* Headline Styles */
  --headline1-font-size: 24px;
  --headline1-font-weight: 600;
  --headline1-margin: 0 0 .5rem;

  --headline2-font-size: 14px;
  --headline2-font-weight: 600;
  --headline2-margin: 1rem 0 .25rem;

  /* Divider Styles */
  --divider-padding: 0 42px;
  --divider-visibility: visible;

  /* Link Styles */
  --link-text-decoration: none;
  --link-text-decoration-hover: underline;

  /* Input Styles */
  --input-min-width: 12em;

  /* Button Styles */
  --button-min-width: max-content;
}
```

### CSS Shadow Parts

In addition to the CSS variables, there is the possibility of using the `::part` selector to equip various elements
with your own styles.

The following parts are available:

- `container` - the UI container
- `headline` - the headline of each page
- `paragraph` - the paragraph elements
- `button` - every button element
- `primary-button` - the primary button
- `secondary-button` - the secondary button on the email login page
- `input` - every input field
- `text-input` - every input field not used for passcodes
- `passcode-input` - the passcode input fields
- `link` - the links in the footer section
- `error` - the error message container
- `error-text` - the error message
- `divider` - the horizontal divider on the login page
- `divider-text` - the divider text
- `divider-line` - the line before and after the `divider-text`
- `form-item` - the container of a form item, e.g. an input field or a button

### CSS classes

There is also the possibility to provide your own CSS rules when the web component has not been attached to the shadow
DOM:

```typescript
register("https://hanko.yourdomain.com",{ shadow: false })
```

Please take a look at the [CSS example](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/raw/main/frontend/elements/example.css) file to see
which CSS rules can be used. If you only want to change specific properties you can override the predefined ones. For
example if you like to change the background color, include the following CSS rule:

```css
.hanko_container {
  background-color: blue !important;
}
```

Also, you can prevent injecting any styles:

```typescript
register("https://hanko.yourdomain.com", { shadow: false, injectStyles: false })
```

so you don't need to override properties but provide the entirety of CSS rules:

```css
.hanko_container {
  background-color: blue;
}

/* more css rules... */
```

If this is your preferred approach, start with the [CSS example](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/raw/main/frontend/elements/example.css)
file, change everything according to your needs and include the CSS in your page.

Keep in mind we made CSS classes available and added light DOM support only because a Safari bug is breaking the
autocompletion of input elements while the web component is attached to the shadow DOM. You would normally prefer to
attach the component to the shadow DOM and make use of CSS parts for UI customization when the CSS variables are not
sufficient.

## Experimental Features

### Conditional Mediation / Autofill assisted Requests

```html
<hanko-auth [...] experimental="conditionalMediation"/>
```

If the browser supports autofill assisted requests, it will hide the "Sign in with passkey" button on the login page and
instead present the available passkeys via the email input's autocompletion menu. Enabling this feature will currently
cause the following issues:

- On iOS 16/Safari you may encounter an issue that WebAuthn credential registration is not working the first time you
  press the button or only after reloading the page.

- Microsoft Edge v. 108 sometimes crashes or is not able to display the credential name properly.

## Demo

Take a look at our [live demo](https://example.hanko.io).
