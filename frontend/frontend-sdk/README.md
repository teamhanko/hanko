## Examples

### Get the current user / Validate the JWT against the Hanko API

The Hanko API issues a JWT when a user logs in. For certain actions, like obtaining the user object, a valid  JWT is
required. The following example shows how to get the user object of the current user, or to identify that the user is
not logged in:

```typescript
import { Hanko, UnauthorizedError } from "@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk"

const hanko = new Hanko("https://[HANKO_API_URL]")

try {
    const user = await hanko.user.getCurrent()

    // A valid JWT is in place so that the user object was able to be fetched.
} catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof UnauthorizedError) {
        // Display an error or prompt the user to login again. After a successful call to `hanko.webauthn.login()`,
        // `hanko.password.login()` or `hanko.passcode.finalize()` a JWT will be issued and `hanko.user.getCurrent()`
        // would succeed.
    }
}
```

### Register a WebAuthn credential

There are a number of situations where you may want the user to register a WebAuthn credential. For example, after user
creation, when a user logs in to a new browser/device, or to take advantage of the "caBLE" support and pair a smartphone
with a desktop computer:

```typescript
import { Hanko, UnauthorizedError, WebauthnRequestCancelledError } from "@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk"

const hanko = new Hanko("https://[HANKO_API_URL]")

// By passing the user object (see example above) to `hanko.webauthn.shouldRegister(user)` you get an indication of
// whether a WebAuthn credential registration should be performed on the current browser. This is useful if the user has
// logged in using a method other than WebAuthn, and you then want to display a UI that allows the user to register a
// credential when possibly none exists.

try {
    // Will cause the browser to present a dialog with various options depending on the WebAuthn implemention.
    await hanko.webauthn.register()

    // Credential has been registered.
} catch(e) {
    if (e instanceof WebauthnRequestCancelledError) {
        // The WebAuthn API failed. Usually in this case the user cancelled the WebAuthn dialog.
    } else if (e instanceof UnauthorizedError) {
        // The user needs to login to perform this action.
    }
}
```

### Custom Events

You can bind callback functions to different custom events. The callback function will be called when the event happens
and an object will be passed in, containing event details. The event binding works as follows:

```typescript
// Controls the optional `once` parameter. When set to `true` the callback function will be called only once.
const once = false;

const removeEventListener = hanko.onSessionCreated((eventDetail) => {
    // Your code...
}, once);

// Removes the event listener, the callback function will not be called anymore.
removeEventListener();

// Removes all event listeners.
hanko.removeEventListeners();
```

The following events are available:

- "hanko-auth-flow-completed": Will be triggered after a session has been created and the user has completed possible
  additional steps (e.g. passkey registration or password recovery) via the `<hanko-auth>` element.

```js
hanko.onAuthFlowCompleted((authFlowCompletedDetail) => {
  // Login, registration or recovery has been completed successfully. You can now take control and redirect the
  // user to protected pages.
  console.info(`User successfully completed the registration or authorization process (user-id: "${authFlowCompletedDetail.userID}")`);
})
```

- "hanko-session-created": Will be triggered before the "hanko-auth-flow-completed" happens, as soon as the user is technically logged in.
  It will also be triggered when the user logs in via another browser window. The event can be used to obtain the JWT. Please note, that the
  JWT is only available, when the Hanko API configuration allows to obtain the JWT. When using Hanko-Cloud
  the JWT is always present, for self-hosted Hanko-APIs you can restrict the cookie to be readable by the backend only, as long as
  your backend runs under the same domain as your frontend. To do so, make sure the config parameter "session.enable_auth_token_header"
  is turned off via the [Hanko-API configuration](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/blob/main/backend/docs/Config.md). If you want the JWT to be contained in the event details, you need to turn on
  "session.enable_auth_token_header" when using a cross-domain setup. When it's a same-domain setup you need to turn off
  "session.cookie.http_only" to make the JWT accessible to the frontend.

```js
hanko.onSessionCreated((sessionDetail) => {
  // A new JWT has been issued.
  console.info(`Session created or updated (user-id: "${sessionDetail.userID}", jwt: ${sessionDetail.jwt})`);
})
```

- "hanko-session-resumed": Will be triggered after the page has been loaded and there is a valid session, so it can be
  utilized like the "hanko-auth-flow-completed" event, to restore the state of your page, where the user is logged in.
  Note, that a "hanko-user-logged-out" event will be triggered instead of the "hanko-session-removed" event, after the
  page has been loaded, when the user does not have a valid session.

```js
hanko.onSessionResumed((sessionDetail) => {
  // The user is logged in, protected content can be shown.
  console.info(`User is already logged in (user-id: "${sessionDetail.userID}", jwt: ${sessionDetail.jwt})`);
})
```

- "hanko-session-expired": Will be triggered when the session has expired, or when the session has been removed in
  another browser window, because the user has logged out, or deleted the account.

```js
hanko.onSessionExpired(() => {
  // You can redirect the user to a login page or show the `<hanko-auth>` element, or to prompt the user to log in again.
  console.info("Session expired");
})
```

- "hanko-user-logged-out": Will be triggered, when the user actively logs out. In other browser windows, a "hanko-session-expired" event
  will be triggered at the same time.

```js
hanko.onUserLoggedOut(() => {
  // You can redirect the user to a login page or show the `<hanko-auth>` element.
  console.info("User logged out");
})
```

- "hanko-user-deleted": Will be triggered when the user has deleted the account. In other browser windows, a "hanko-session-expired" event
  will be triggered at the same time.

```js
hanko.onUserDeleted(() => {
  // You can redirect the user to a login page or show the `<hanko-auth>` element.
  console.info("User has been deleted");
})
```
