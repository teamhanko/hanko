# Login With Google

To enable Google login for your project, you need to

- Create and configure a Google Project on the Google Cloud Platform Console.
- Create and add your Google OAuth credentials to your Hanko backend configuration.
- Add the Hanko `auth` web component or add the required code to your JS Client App using the `hanko-frontend-sdk`.

## Access your Google Cloud Platform account

- Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com).
- Click on 'Sign in' at the top right to log in. If you do not have an account yet, create one.

## Create a Google Cloud Platform project

- Click on 'Select a Project' at the top left.
- Click 'New Project' at the top right.
- Provide a 'Project name'.
- If you want the project to be part of an organization, assign it using the 'Location' input.
- Click Create. On success, you should now view the dashboard for your new project.

## Set up OAuth consent screen

On your project's dashboard:

- In the search bar at the top labeled 'Search for resources, docs, products, and more' type 'oauth'.
- Click on 'OAuth consent screen' from the list of results.
- On the OAuth consent screen page select:
    - 'External' if you want the project to be available to anyone with a Google Account.
    - 'Internal' if the project is associated with an organization, and you want to restrict access to members of the
      organization.
- Click Create.

## Edit app registration

- Provide 'App information', 'App logo', and 'App domain' data. You do not need to add an 'Authorised domain' at this
  point. An entry will be added automatically once you set up your credentials. Click 'Save and continue'.
- On the 'Scopes' view, click 'Add or remove scopes' and select the 'userinfo.email' scope. Click 'Update', then
  'Save and continue'.
- On the 'Test users' view, click 'Add users' to set up test users as long as your project is unpublished. Click
  'Save and continue'.
- Review your data in the 'Summary' view, then click 'Back to dashboard'.

## Get your callback URL

- Before creating your OAuth app, you need to be aware of the provider callback URL. This is where the third party
provider redirects after a successful login. The callback URL consists of the base URL of your running
Hanko backend instance and the `/thirdparty/callback` endpoint:

```https://<your_hanko_backend_instance>/thirdparty/callback```

## Create your Google credentials

On your project's dashboard:

- In the search bar at the top labeled 'Search for resources, docs, products, and more' type 'oauth'.
- Click 'Credentials' in the search results.
- Click 'Create Credentials' at the top, select 'OAuth client ID'
- On the Create OAuth client ID page, select your application type. Select 'Web application'.
- Enter your app name.
- Under 'Authorized redirect URIs' click 'Add URI' and add your callback URL in the input.
- Click 'Create'.

## Configure Google credentials with your Hanko backend


Open up your backend [configuration file](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/blob/main/backend/config/config.yaml) add
the following:

```yaml
third_party:
  # URL the backend redirects to if an error occurs during third party sign-in. Errors are provided
  # as 'error' and 'error_description' query params in the redirect location URL.
  #
  # When using the Hanko web components it should be the URL of the page that embeds the web component
  # such that errors can be processed properly by the web component.
  #
  # You do not have to add this URL to the 'allowed_redirect_urls', it is automatically included when
  # validating redirect URLs.
  #
  # NOTE: MUST NOT have trailing slash
  error_redirect_url: <your_error_redirect_url>
  # List of URLS the backend is allowed to redirect to after third party sign-in was successful.
  #
  # When using the Hanko web components it should be the URL of the page that embeds the
  # web component.
  #
  # Supports wildcard matching through globbing. e.g. https://*.example.com will allow
  # https://foo.example.com and https://bar.example.com to be accepted. Globbing is also
  # supported for paths, e.g. https://foo.example.com/* will match https://foo.example.com/page1
  # and https://foo.example.com/page2.
  #
  # More on globbing: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gobwas/glob#Compile
  #
  # NOTE: URLs in the list MUST NOT have trailing slash
  allowed_redirect_urls:
      - <your_redirect_url>
  redirect_url: https://<your_hanko_backend_instance>/thirdparty/callback
  providers:
    google:
      enabled: true
      client_id: <your_google_client_id>
      secret: <your_google_client_secret>
```

## Enable login in your frontend app

### With Hanko Elements

Depending on what framework your frontend uses, integrate the `auth` web component from the `hanko-elements` package
according to one of our [frontend guides](/guides/frontend). If everything was successful, the component should now
render a button to login with GitHub on the login view.

:::note

Make sure to configure the page the web component is embedded on as both your `error_redirect_url` as well
as an `allowed_redirect_url` in your `third_party` settings.

:::

On successful authentication with the third party provider, the backend issues a JWT (as a cookie or - if enabled
via backend [configuration](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/blob/main/backend/docs/Config.md) option
`session.enable_auth_token_header` - via `X-Auth-Token` header). The web component recognizes this and continues the
usual component flow on success or displays errors that occurred during third party
provider authentication accordingly.

### With Hanko Frontend SDK

When building your own UI, you can use the `@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk` to initialize third party sign in.
Call `hanko.thirdParty.auth` with `google` as your provider and the target URL in your app you want to redirect to
after successful third party authentication (must be configured as an allowed redirect url via
`third_party.allowed_redirect_urls`).

```js showLineNumbers
import { Hanko } from "@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk"

const hanko = new Hanko("<your_hanko_backend_instance>")

async function signInWithGoogle() {
    try {
       await hanko.thirdParty.auth("google", "<your_redirect_url>");
    } catch (error) {
      // handle error
    }
}
```

On successful authentication with the third party provider, the backend issues a JWT (as a cookie or - if enabled
via backend [configuration](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/blob/main/backend/docs/Config.md) option
`session.enable_auth_token_header` - via `X-Auth-Token` header) and redirects to the
target URL provided in the `hanko.thirdParty.auth` call.
