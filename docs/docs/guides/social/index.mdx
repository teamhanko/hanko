Social Login allows using existing credentials from a third party provider (like
Google or GitHub) to sign in to a third party website instead of explicitly creating a new account and new credentials
on that website. This simplifies registrations and logins for end users.

## Before you get started

- If you plan on using Hanko Cloud, you need a [Hanko Cloud Console](https://cloud.hanko.io) account.
  - Once signed in, create an `Organization`.
  - In your organization, create a new `Project`. All third party provider settings are done on the project level.
- If you plan on self-hosting, you need to have a running instance of the [Hanko API](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/tree/main/backend#hanko-backend).
- If you prefer a prebuilt UI, then the easiest way to integrate Hanko social logins in your frontend app is to use the
[`@teamhanko/hanko-elements`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teamhanko/hanko-elements)
web components. If you want to build your own UI, you can use the
[`@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk). Learn more about frontend
app integration in the provider specific guides below.

## Limitations

- Social logins currently mainly target classic web applications (as opposed to, e.g. native mobile apps) and use
the OAuth [authorization code flow](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.3.1).
- Sign up with a third party provider is only allowed if the email address used with the provider is not also
used by an existing Hanko user.
- Only one third party provider can be linked to a Hanko user.
- Requesting additional OAuth scopes with a provider is not possible.
