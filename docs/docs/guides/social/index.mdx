import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

Social Login allows using existing credentials from a third party provider (like
Google or GitHub) to sign in to a third party website instead of explicitly creating a new account and new credentials
on that website. This simplifies registrations and logins for end users.

Social logins currently mainly target classic web applications (as opposed to, e.g. native mobile apps) and use
the OAuth [authorization code flow](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.3.1).

Get started with your favourite third party provider:

<DocCardList/>
