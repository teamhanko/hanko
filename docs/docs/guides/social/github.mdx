# Login with GitHub

To enable GitHub login for your project, you need to
- Create a GitHub OAuth application
- Create and add your Google OAuth credentials to your Hanko backend configuration
- Add the Hanko `auth` web component or add the required code to your JS Client App using the `hanko-frontend-sdk`.

## Access your GitHub account

- Go to [github.com](https://github.com).
- Click on 'Sign In' at the top right to log in. If you do not have an account yet, create one.

## Create a GitHub Oauth App

Go to the [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) page:

- Click on your profile photo at the top right
- Click Settings near the bottom of the menu
- In the left sidebar, click Developer settings (near the bottom)
- In the left sidebar, click OAuth Apps

## Get your callback URL

- Before creating your Oauth app, you need to be aware of the provider callback URL. This is where the third party
provider redirects after a successful login. The callback URL consists of the base URL of your running
Hanko backend instance and the `/thirdparty/callback` endpoint:

  ```https://<your_hanko_backend_instance>/thirdparty/callback```


## Create a new OAuth application

- On GitHub, click 'Register a new application' or 'New OAuth app' if you created one before.
- Fill in the required information
  - In 'Application name', enter the name of your app.
  - In 'Homepage URL', enter the full URL to your app (i.e. `https://<your_hanko_backend_instance`)
  - In 'Authorization callback URL', enter the callback URL of your app (see the previous step).
- Click 'Register application'. You should now see an overview of your OAuth app
- Copy and save the 'Client ID'
- Click 'Generate a new client secret'.
- Copy and save the 'Client secret'


## Configure GitHub credentials with your Hanko backend

Open up your backend [configuration file](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/blob/main/backend/config/config.yaml) add
the following:

```yaml
third_party:
  # URL the backend redirects to if an error occurs during third party sign-in. Errors are provided
  # as 'error' and 'error_description' query params in the redirect location URL.
  #
  # When using the Hanko web components it should be the URL of the page that embeds the web component
  # such that errors can be processed properly by the web component.
  #
  # You do not have to add this URL to the 'allowed_redirect_urls', it is automatically included when
  # validating redirect URLs.
  #
  # NOTE: URLs MUST NOT have trailing slash
  error_redirect_url: <your_error_redirect_url>
  # List of URLS the backend is allowed to redirect to after third party sign-in was successful.
  #
  # When using the Hanko web components it should be the URL of the page that embeds the
  # web component.
  #
  # Supports wildcard matching through globbing. e.g. https://*.example.com will allow
  # https://foo.example.com and https://bar.example.com to be accepted. Globbing is also
  # supported for paths, e.g. https://foo.example.com/* will match https://foo.example.com/page1
  # and https://foo.example.com/page2.
  #
  # More on globbing: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gobwas/glob#Compile
  #
  # NOTE: URLs in the list MUST NOT have trailing slash
  allowed_redirect_urls:
      - <your_redirect_url>
  redirect_url: https://<your_hanko_backend_instance>/thirdparty/callback
  providers:
    github:
      enabled: true
      client_id: <your_github_client_id>
      secret: <your_github_client_secret>
```

## Enable login in your frontend app

### With Hanko Elements

Depending on what framework your frontend uses, integrate the `auth` web component from the `hanko-elements` package
according to one of our [frontend guides](/guides/frontend). If everything was successful, the component should now
render a button to login with GitHub on the login view.

:::note

Make sure to configure the page the web component is embedded on as both your `error_redirect_url` as well
as an `allowed_redirect_url` in your `third_party` settings.

:::

On successful authentication with the third party provider, the backend issues a JWT (as a cookie or - if enabled
via backend [configuration](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/blob/main/backend/docs/Config.md) option
`session.enable_auth_token_header` - via `X-Auth-Token` header). The web component recognizes this and continues the
usual component flow on success or displays errors that occurred during third party
provider authentication accordingly.

### With Hanko Frontend SDK

When building your own UI, you can use the `@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk` to initialize third party sign in.
Call `hanko.thirdParty.auth` with `github` as your provider and the target URL in your app you want to redirect to
after successful third party authentication (must be configured as an allowed redirect url via
`third_party.allowed_redirect_urls`).

```js showLineNumbers
import { Hanko } from "@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk"

const hanko = new Hanko("<your_hanko_backend_instance>")

async function signInWithGitHub() {
    try {
       await hanko.thirdParty.auth("github", "<your_redirect_url>");
    } catch (error) {
      // handle error
    }
}
```

On successful authentication with the third party provider, the backend issues a JWT (as a cookie or - if enabled
via backend [configuration](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/blob/main/backend/docs/Config.md) option
`session.enable_auth_token_header` - via `X-Auth-Token` header) and redirects to the
target URL provided in the `hanko.thirdParty.auth` call.
