# About Hanko
Hanko is an open-source user authentication system with a focus on moving the login beyond passwords, while being 100% deployable today – without compromise.

- Built around latest [passkey](https://www.passkeys.io) technology as introduced by Apple, Google, and Microsoft
- An API for passkeys, email passcodes, and optional password support
- Hanko web component ("login box") that integrates with just 2 lines of code
- API-first, small footprint, cloud-native
- FIDO2-certified

Hanko is built and maintained by [Hanko.io](https://www.hanko.io), an active member of the [FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/company/hanko/). This project is the sum of 5 years of experience implementing FIDO and WebAuthn-based authentication in many different applications and platforms.

# We take you on the journey beyond passwords ...
... and make sure your users won't get lost on the way. Passwordless logins have been promised to us for quite some time. But until now, "passwordless" was mostly a compromise that only worked for some of the users and had some severe drawbacks that ultimately led to passwords still being present at almost every login. It's only very recently that passkeys were announced and the ecosystem of devices, browsers, and operating systems is finally ready to truly move beyond passwords.

With most devices now shipping with passkey support and biometric sensors like Touch ID, Face ID, and Windows Hello, a truly fascinating login experience is enabled that has the potential to replace passwords for good. Hanko is built for that shift.

**Build your passkey login in just 5 minutes – with two lines of code – and never look back.**

# Quickstart
The fastest way to try out Hanko is with [docker-compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

First you need to clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko.git
```

Then, in the newly created `hanko` folder, just run:
```
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose/quickstart.yaml -p "hanko-quickstart" up --build
```
> **Note**: Docker (Desktop) needs to be running in order for the command to run.

After the services are up and running, the login page can be viewed at `localhost:8888`. To receive emails without your own
smtp server, we added [mailslurper](https://github.com/mailslurper/mailslurper) which will be available at `localhost:8080`.

> **Note**: Hanko services are not published to a registry yet and will be built locally before the services are started.
