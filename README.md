# About Hanko
Hanko is an open source authentication and user management solution with a focus on moving the login beyond passwords, while being 100% deployable today.

- Built for [passkeys](https://www.passkeys.io) as introduced by Apple, Google, and Microsoft
- Fast integration with Hanko Elements web components (login box and user profile)
- API-first, small footprint, cloud-native

Available for self-hosting and on [Hanko Cloud](https://www.hanko.io).

Hanko is built and maintained by [Hanko.io](https://www.hanko.io), an active member of the [FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/company/hanko/). This project is the sum of 5 years of experience implementing FIDO and WebAuthn-based authentication in different applications and platforms.

# We take you on the journey beyond passwords ...
... and make sure your users won't get lost on the way. Passwordless logins have been promised to us for quite some time. But until now, "passwordless" was mostly a compromise that only worked for some of the users and had some severe drawbacks that ultimately led to passwords still being present at almost every login. It's only very recently that passkeys were announced and the ecosystem of devices, browsers, and operating systems is finally ready to truly move beyond passwords.

With most devices and browsers now shipping with passkey support and convenient built-in authentication technology like Touch ID, Face ID, and Windows Hello, a much better login experience is enabled that will replace passwords for good. Hanko is built for that shift.

**Build your passkey-powered auth stack with a few lines of code ‚Äì and never look back.**

# Architecture
The main building blocks of the Hanko project are
- [backend](/backend/README.md) - An authentication API for passkeys, passcodes, and (optional) passwords, OAuth SSO, as well as user management and JWT issuing
- [hanko-elements](/frontend/elements/README.md) - Web components made for Hanko backend that provide onboarding and login functionality and are customizable with CSS
- [hanko-frontend-sdk](/frontend/frontend-sdk/README.md) - A client package for using the Hanko API

The remainder of the repository consists of:
- [quickstart](/quickstart) - A quickstart example app, showing off Hanko's login experience and acting as a reference implementation
- [examples](frontend/examples) - Example implementations for a number of frameworks
- [docs](/docs) - The Hanko documentation ([docs.hanko.io](https://docs.hanko.io))

# Getting started
1. Try our hosted [live example](https://example.hanko.io) and our companion page [passkeys.io](https://www.passkeys.io) or use the [quickstart app](/quickstart/README.md) to get a feel for the user experience provided by an application that leverages the Hanko backend API and our custom web component
2. Head over to the [backend](/backend/README.md) to learn how to get it up and running for your own project. Use [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) for a hosted backend.
3. Then, integrate [hanko-elements](/frontend/elements/README.md) ‚Äì we provide [example applications](frontend/examples/README.md) and [guides](https://docs.hanko.io/guides/frontend) for your favourite frontend framework in the official documentation

If you want to use the Hanko backend API but prefer to build your own UI, you can still make use of the [hanko-frontend-sdk](/frontend/frontend-sdk/README.md). It forms the basis of our web components and the client it provides handles communication with the Hanko backend API and saves you the time of rolling your own.
