# About Hanko
Hanko is an open-source user authentication system with a focus on moving the login beyond passwords, while being 100% deployable today ‚Äì without compromise.

- Built around latest [passkey](https://www.passkeys.io) technology as introduced by Apple, Google, and Microsoft
- An API for passkeys, email passcodes, and optional password support
- Hanko web component ("login box") that integrates with just 2 lines of code
- API-first, small footprint, cloud-native
- FIDO2-certified

Hanko is built and maintained by [Hanko.io](https://www.hanko.io), an active member of the [FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/company/hanko/). This project is the sum of 5 years of experience implementing FIDO and WebAuthn-based authentication in many different applications and platforms.

# We take you on the journey beyond passwords ...
... and make sure your users won't get lost on the way. Passwordless logins have been promised to us for quite some time. But until now, "passwordless" was mostly a compromise that only worked for some of the users and had some severe drawbacks that ultimately led to passwords still being present at almost every login. It's only very recently that passkeys were announced and the ecosystem of devices, browsers, and operating systems is finally ready to truly move beyond passwords.

With most devices now shipping with passkey support and biometric sensors like Touch ID, Face ID, and Windows Hello, a truly fascinating login experience is enabled that has the potential to replace passwords for good. Hanko is built for that shift.

**Build your passkey login in just 5 minutes ‚Äì with two lines of code ‚Äì and never look back.**

# Architecture
The main building blocks of the Hanko project are
- [backend](/backend/README.md) - An authentication API powering passkeys, passcodes, and passwords, as well as user management and JWT token issuing
- [hanko-elements](/frontend/elements/README.md) - A slick web component made for Hanko backend that features a polished onboarding and login experience and is highly customizable
- [hanko-frontend-sdk](/frontend/frontend-sdk/README.md) - A client package for using the Hanko API

The remainder of the repository contents consist of:
- [quickstart](/quickstart) - The quickstart example app, showing off Hanko's login experience and acting as a reference implementation
- [examples](/examples) - Hanko example implementations for a number of frameworks
- [docs](/docs) - The Hanko documentation

# Getting started

- **I am still unsure what Hanko is all about**: try our hosted [live example](https://example.hanko.io) or use
  the [quickstart](/quickstart/README.md) to get a feel for the user experience provided by an application that leverages the
  Hanko backend API and our custom web component.
- **I need an authentication API for my project, but I do not want to build it myself**: head over to our
  [backend](/backend/README.md) to learn how to get it up and running.
- **I also need a registration/login UI in my frontend, but I do not want to build it myself**:
  [hanko-elements](/frontend/elements/README.md) provides the custom element/web component that powers
  the [live example](https://example.hanko.io) and our companion page [passkeys.io](https://passkeys.io).
  We also provide [guides](https://docs.hanko.io/guides/frontend) in the official documentation on how to integrate the
  web component(s) with your favourite frontend framework as well as [example](/examples/README.md) applications.
- **I want to use the Hanko backend API but prefer to build my own UI**: you can still make
  use of the [hanko-frontend-sdk](/frontend/frontend-sdk/README.md). It forms the basis of our web components. The client it
  provides handles communication with the Hanko backend API and saves you the time of rolling your own.
