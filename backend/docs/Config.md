  # For every key a JWK is generated, encrypted with the key and persisted in the database.
  #
  # You can use this list for key rotation: add a new key to the beginning of the list and the corresponding
  # JWK will then be used for signing JWTs. All tokens signed with the previous JWK(s) will still
  # be valid until they expire. Removing a key from the list does not remove the corresponding
  # database record. If you remove a key, you also have to remove the database record, otherwise
  # application startup will fail.

    #
    display_name: ""
    ## origin ##
    #
    # The origin for which WebAuthn credentials will be accepted by the server. Must include the protocol and can only be the effective domain,
    # or a registrable domain suffix of the effective domain, as specified in the id. Except for localhost, the protocol must always be https for WebAuthn to work.
    #
    # Example:
    # - http://localhost
    # - https://example.com
    # - https://subdomain.example.com
    #
    origin: "http://localhost"
```

## Explanation

### Web Authentication

For most use cases, you just need the domain of your website that Hanko will be used with. Set `id` to the domain and set `origin` to the domain but include the protocol.

#### Examples

When you have a website hosted at `example.com` and you want to add a login to it that will be available
at `https://example.com/login`, the WebAuthn config would look like this:

```yaml
webauthn:
  relying_party:
    id: "example.com"
    display_name: "Example Project"
    origin: "https://example.com"
```

If the login should be available at `https://login.example.com` instead, then the WebAuthn config would look like this:

```yaml
webauthn:
  relying_party:
    id: "login.example.com"
    display_name: "Example Project"
    origin: "https://login.example.com"
```

Given the above scenario, you still may want to bind your users WebAuthn credentials to `example.com` if you plan to add other services on other subdomains later that should be able to use existing credentials. Another reason can be if you want to have the option to move your login from `https://login.example.com` to `https://example.com/login` at some point. Then the WebAuthn config would look like this:

```yaml
webauthn:
  relying_party:
    id: "example.com"
    display_name: "Example Project"
    origin: "https://login.example.com"
```

> **Note**: Currently, only a single origin is supported. We plan to add support for a list of origins at some point.
