# Hanko backend config

The Hanko backend can be configured using a `yaml` configuration file or using environment variables.
Environment variables have higher precedence than configuration via file (i.e. if provided, they overwrite the values
given in the file - multivalued options, like arrays, are also _not_ merged but overwritten entirely).

The schema for the configuration file is given below. To set equivalent environment variables, join keys by `_`
(underscore) and uppercase the keys, i.e. for `server.webauthn.relying_party.origins`
use:

```shell
export SERVER_WEBAUTHN_RELYING_PARTY_ORIGINS="https://hanko.io,android:apk-key-hash:nLSu7w..."
```


## All available config options

      allow_origins:
        - "https://hanko.io"
        - "https://example.com"
      ## unsafe_wildcard_origin_allowed ##
      #
      # If allow_origins contains a wildcard '*' origin, this flag must explicitly be set to 'true'.
      # Using wildcard '*' origins is insecure and potentially leads to cross-origin attacks.
      #

  ## admin ##
  #
  # Configuration for the admin API.
  #
  admin:
    ## address ##

  #
  # You can use this list for key rotation: add a new key to the beginning of the list and the corresponding
  # JWK will then be used for signing JWTs. All tokens signed with the previous JWK(s) will still
  # be valid until they expire. Removing a key from the list does not remove the corresponding
  # database record. If you remove a key, you also have to remove the database record, otherwise
  # application startup will fail.
