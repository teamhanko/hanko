# Hanko backend config

The Hanko backend can be configured using a `yaml` configuration file or using environment variables.
Environment variables have higher precedence than configuration via file (i.e. if provided, they overwrite the values
given in the file - multivalued options, like arrays, are also _not_ merged but overwritten entirely).

The schema for the configuration file is given below. To set equivalent environment variables, join keys by `_`
(underscore) and uppercase the keys, i.e. for `server.webauthn.relying_party.origins`
use:

```shell
export SERVER_WEBAUTHN_RELYING_PARTY_ORIGINS="https://hanko.io,android:apk-key-hash:nLSu7w..."
```


## All available config options

```yaml
## Hanko Service configuration ##
#

server:
  ## public ##
  #
  # Configuration for the public API.
  #
  public:

      #
      allow_origins:
        - "https://hanko.io"
        - "https://example.com"
      ## unsafe_wildcard_origin_allowed ##
      #
      # If allow_origins contains a wildcard '*' origin, this flag must explicitly be set to 'true'.
      # Using wildcard '*' origins is insecure and potentially leads to cross-origin attacks.
      #

  ## admin ##
  #
  # Configuration for the admin API.
  #
  admin:
    ## address ##

  #
  # Keys secrets are used to en- and decrypt the JWKs which get used to sign the JWTs.

  #
  # You can use this list for key rotation: add a new key to the beginning of the list and the corresponding
  # JWK will then be used for signing JWTs. All tokens signed with the previous JWK(s) will still
  # be valid until they expire. Removing a key from the list does not remove the corresponding
  # database record. If you remove a key, you also have to remove the database record, otherwise
  # application startup will fail.

  # your running hanko backend instance and the callback endpoint, i.e. <YOUR_BACKEND_INSTANCE>/thirdparty/callback.
  #
  redirect_url: "CHANGE_ME"
  ## allowed_redirect_urls
  #
  # Required if any providers are enabled.
  # List of URLS the backend is allowed to redirect to after third party sign-in was successful.
  # (see also the 'redirect_to' parameter for the third party auth initialization endpoint
  # - https://docs.hanko.io/api/public#tag/Third-Party/operation/thirdPartyAuth)
  #
  # Supports wildcard matching through globbing. e.g. https://*.example.com will allow https://foo.example.com and https://bar.example.com to be accepted.
  # Globbing is also supported for paths, e.g. https://foo.example.com/* will match https://foo.example.com/page1 and https://foo.example.com/page2.
  # A double asterisk (`**`) acts as a "super"-wildcard/match-all.
  #
  # More on globbing: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gobwas/glob#Compile
  #
  # NOTE: URLs in the list MUST NOT have trailing slash
  #
  # Examples:
  # - http://localhost:8888
  #
  allowed_redirect_urls:
    - "CHANGE_ME"
  ##
  #
  # Required if any providers are enabled. URL the backend redirects to if an error occurs during third party sign-in. Errors are provided
  # as 'error' and 'error_description' query params in the redirect location URL.
  #
  # When using the Hanko web components it should be the URL of the page that embeds the web component such that
  # errors can be processed properly by the web component.
  #
  # You do not have to add this URL to the 'allowed_redirect_urls', it is automatically included when validating
  # redirect URLs.
  #
  # NOTE: MUST NOT have trailing slash

  # Example:
  # - http://localhost:8888/error
