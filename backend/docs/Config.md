## database ##
#
# Configures the backend where to persist data.
#
database:
  host: "localhost"
  ## port ##
  #
  # Default value: 5432
  #
  port: "5432"
  ## dialect ##
  #
  # Which database will be used.
  #
  # One of:
  # - cockroach
  # - mariadb
  # - mysql
  # - postgres
  #
  dialect: "postgres"
  user: "CHANGE-ME"
  password: "CHANGE-ME"
  database: "CHANGE-ME"
  ## url ##
  #
  # Instead of using the individual fields above this field can be used.
  # When this field is set, it will be used and the fields above have no effect.
  #
  # Url schema: `dialect://username:password@host:port/database`
  #
  # Examples:
  # - postgres://hanko:hanko@localhost:5432/hanko
  #
  url: "CHANGE-ME"
service:
  ## name ##
  #
  # The name of the service. This value will be used in the subject header of emails.
  #

secrets:
  ## keys ##
  #
  # Keys secrets are used to en- and decrypt the JWKs which get used to sign the JWTs.
  # For every key a JWK is generated, encrypted with the key and persisted in the database.
  #
  # You can use this list for key rotation: add a new key to the beginning of the list and the corresponding
  # JWK will then be used for signing JWTs. All tokens signed with the previous JWK(s) will still
  # be valid until they expire. Removing a key from the list does not remove the corresponding
  # database record. If you remove a key, you also have to remove the database record, otherwise
  # application startup will fail.
  #
  # Each key must be at least 16 characters long.

emails:
  ## require_verification
  #
  # If turned on (true), email addresses must be verified to be assigned to a user. During account creation the user has
  # to verify the email address before a JWT can be issued and further email addresses can only be added after they have
  # been verified. If require_verification is turned off, the mentioned verification steps aren't necessary (and will be
  # skipped by hanko-elements), so the user can create an account without email verification and further email addresses
  # can be added directly.
